# Rules

* **Requirements**: 2-4 players
* **Duration**: ??? minutes
* **Objective**: Plunder loot from other ships and be the first to earn enough `victory points`.

## Components

There are 3 `ship` card decks, 1 `item` card deck, and 6 starting `junk ship` cards.

### Ship Cards

These cards are split into decks that represent ships for a specific `region`, shown on the back side of the cards:

* Baylands ships
* Deepwater ships
* Swamp ships

The front-side of these cards shows their details, including:

* Which `slots` the ship has, including their `location` and `type`.
* Any abilities it has.
* Its `power`/`toughness`, before any items are added to it.

### Item cards

These cards represent items that can be used to outfit a ship. The front-side of these cards shows their details, including:

* In which `slot` it can be used (either in a `deck` slot of a ship, or a `hold` slot).
* Any abilities it has.
* How much `power`/`toughness` that this item adds to the ship.

The back-side shows in which `location` it can be used, and what `type` it is. If it displays multiple options, then it satisfies any of them.

## Setup

To set up the game:

1. Shuffle each of the ship region decks separately, and the item deck together.
1. Give each player one starting `junk ship` card.

## How to Play a Turn

During the game, players take turns where they will reveal cards from a deck and either trade for those cards, or attack them.

### Start of a turn

At the beginning of their turn, a player must:

1. Pick a deck -- either the `item` deck or any `region` deck.
1. Reveal the top three cards of that deck.

### Option 1: Trade

1. Discard any number of cards from their hand and sum their total `value`.
1. Take any number of revealed cards with a total `value` less than or equal to the total value of discarded cards.
1. Discard any remaining cards from the table.

### Option 2: Attack

#### Outfitting the player's ship

If a player wishes to attack, they must first pick and outfit their ship:

1. Place a ship in front of the player. This can be the starting `junk ship` card.
1. For each `deck` slot on the ship card, place up to one item that says `deck` above the ship card.
1. For each `hold` slot on the ship card, place up to one item that says `deck` below the ship card. Keep in mind that many items are "inactive" in the hold and cannot be used when attacking other ships.

#### Outfitting the attacked ship

1. Pick a `region` deck to attack.
1. Pick one of the `ship` cards to target, while discarding the rest.
1. For each `deck` slot on the targetted ship, search the `items` deck until they find a card that matches the `slot`'s `location` and `type`. Reveal the card and place it above the targetted ship.
1. For each `hold` slot on the targetted ship, search the `items` deck until they find a card that matches the `slot`'s `location` and `type`. Keep the card face down and place it below the targetting ship.
1. If the player still wishes to attack, see the next section. Otherwise, discard each of the target ship's cards and their turn is over.

#### Which Ship Won?

Many cards have a `power`/`toughness` value in the bottom right corner. The winner of an attack is determined by a comparison of `power` and `toughness` after all items and abilities are counted. For each ship:

1. Read and follow the instructions for the abilities of each card, if present.
1. Sum all of the `power` values for the `ship` card and each of its `item` cards. This is the total `power` for the ship.
1. Sum all of the `toughness` values for the `ship` card and each of its `item` cards. This is the total `toughness` for the ship.

If the target ship's `power` is greater than the player ship's `toughness`, the player ship is destroyed. Discard all cards for the ship, except the `spirit` card if used.

If the player ship's `power` is greater than the target ship's `toughness`, the target ship is destroyed. The player may follow the [outfitting]() steps using any of the cards for either ship. Discard all other cards not used this way.

### End of the Game

Some cards have a `victory point` value as part of their ability. The game ends when one player has 10 `spirit point`s in their hand.
