### Did it work?
  * Funamentally, yes. The systems functioned. And it was easy to pick up and understrand.
  * Combat was not balanced. Hard to progress due to the high toughness vs low power.
  * After ~3 turns each, still were using the starting Spirit cards.

### Was it fun?
  * Straight calculation of winner is anticlimactic. Maybe use dice rolls. 
  * Woud like more agency, such as spirit powers.
  * Felt bad when you lost and had no ability to affect the outcome.
  * There are nugs of fun. I like drawing items to build the ships.

### Did it work?
  * Yes.
  * But we were still using starting spirit cards after 4+ turns.
  * We had huge hands of items and ships and nothing to do with them.

### Did it work?
  * It didn't feel broken, but there was a lot of "bad luck" with the dice rolls and draws. Dice rolls felt hopeless.
  * Didn't play to completion after like 40m of playing.
  * Knowing how to compare a ship's power vs toughness was confusing.
  * Colors made it easy to understand. Maybe bigger text or icon would help too.
  * Feels more pirate in theme than spirit.

### Was it fun?
  * Slow to get started, but agency increased over time. It was most fun when having decisions to make.
  * Never got to the 2nd pool of ships. Maybe make the regions of ships less distributed in power level so players will always win in the 1st region and get stuff to take to the 2nd.
  * Least fun trying to figure out the numbers and their significance.
  * Doesn't feel like competing with other players. Which isn't a bad thing. But more interaction could be good.
  * There may need to be a way to rubber-band and let a "losing" player catch up.

* Played a quick 4 turns and still didn't have a ship worth using. Might need to ramp faster. I want this to be playable in <1h and ideally ~30m.
