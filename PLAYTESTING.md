### Did it work?
  * Funamentally, yes. The systems functioned. And it was easy to pick up and understrand.
  * Combat was not balanced. Hard to progress due to the high toughness vs low power.
  * After ~3 turns each, still were using the starting Spirit cards.

### Was it fun?
  * Straight calculation of winner is anticlimactic. Maybe use dice rolls. 
  * Woud like more agency, such as spirit powers.
  * Felt bad when you lost and had no ability to affect the outcome.
  * There are nugs of fun. I like drawing items to build the ships.
