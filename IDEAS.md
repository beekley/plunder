# Ideas

A list of ideas for the game. There are no wrong answers. If implemented, check its checkbox. If no longer considered, ~~strike it out~~.

- [ ] Each ship has an ability that is unique to that ship, so they feel individually interesting. Maybe it can only be used by a player.
- [ ] Players can sell or trade items/ships they get.
- [ ] Players can attack each other.
- [ ] Players must spend a turn returning home from battle, so they have to make a decision whether to keep fighting new ships, or come back.
- [ ] On their turn, players can either attack or do something else, like sell items or get a free item.
